Ndialog is an attempt to duplicate the functionality of Savio Lam's
curses-based dialog (repeatedly forked for various applications,
GPLed fairly early on) without being encumbered with the GPL.   I
originally wrote it when my attempts to shoehorn new features into
{whatever version of dialog came with SLS and/or Slackware} collided
with the existing mass of code.


The library sources are in the src subdirectory; a copy of the dialog(1)
program is in the dialog subdirectory.


To build, run

   ./configure.sh && make
   
from the toplevel directory (you can also manually cd into the src
subdirectory and do the make).  This will generate the file
libndialog.a, which can then be linked with your application (plus
-lpanel & -lncurses, which are obviously needed)

There are four options that configure.sh accepts

    --with-bsd-curses	Use BSD curses if available
    --with-getcap	Use the getcap() function to get
			function key definitions.
    --with-amalloc	Use my paranoid memory allocator to try and
			track memory leaks
    --shared		Try to build shared libraries


A description of the library interface is in the directory src/doc,
in my helpfile format (which is a subset of html;  opening
src/doc/index.html with any browser will work)
