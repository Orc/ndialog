Ndialog is an attempt to duplicate the functionality of Savio Lam's
curses-based dialog (repeatedly forked for various applications,
GPLed fairly early on) without being encumbered with the GPL.   I
originally wrote it when my attempts to shoehorn new features into
{whatever version of dialog came with SLS and/or Slackware} collided
with the existing mass of code.


Currently I only implement the library interface because the
application I was using it for was the Mastodon installer, which
is a single C program that wraps a UI around the business of
installing a system.   It would not be difficult to write a shell
script interface for it, but I just haven't done that.


To build, run

   ./configure.sh
   
from the toplevel directory, then cd into the src subdirectory
and do a make.  This will generate the file libndialog.a, which
can then be linked with your application (plus -lpanel & -lncurses,
which are obviously needed)

There are four options that configure.sh accepts

    --with-bsd-curses	Use BSD curses in available
    --with-getcap	Use the getcap() function to get
			function get definitions.
    --with-amalloc	Use my paranoid memory allocator to try and
			track memory leaks
    --shared		Try to build shared libraries (only tested on macos)


A description of the library interface is in the directory src/doc,
in my helpfile format (which is a subset of html;  opening
src/doc/index.html with any browser will work)
